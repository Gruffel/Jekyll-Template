# Hello CAS-IT! 👋
*(This is a file for the GitLab Repo.)*

## 🚧 This Repo and website is to act as a dev site for testing changes. 🚧  ⚗️🏗️👩‍💻👨‍💻
We build some blank and filler pages, with some features/components in it. The aim for the work in here is to perfect your code that you want to bring into the Main Template Core repo (named: 'cjcms-template').

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ !IMPORTANT ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Please feel free to make what ever code in here but note that when trying to make changes to the core template we will need to access a version of that repo separately and only embed the core changes and not content. Note the changes to the template will be with out the ability to see/test changes that repo itself, that is what this repo is for Testing and Developing. 

**🔥🔥🔥 If one was to do that, it would cause any 'content' created to test to also be included into the template and thusly be replicated across all of our live websites as well (which we do not want)! 🔥🔥🔥**
