Jekyll Template 2.1.1
This copy is the most up to date version of my work with the Jekyll template. 
It is near the end of completion but it is not yet finished.

# Jekyll Template Work

Notes on template iterations and scopes:
- **Jekyll Template 1.0 - 1.7.5**
The soul purpose of this version was to quickly leave the depricated environment of Adobe's Contribute and move into this custom template and CMS. We kept the as much of the designs as possible unless there were negative impacts from the conversion. (Quick and functionable)
- **Jekyll Template 2.0 +** 
This version was/is a redesign of the template, allowing for improvements in branding, asthetics, and perfomance. We were able to create newer components that were needed and others were requested. (More time, and more detail)
